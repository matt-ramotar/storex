## Overview

This directory contains the archived production readiness review documentation from the monolithic `:store` module. The review identified and resolved **all critical (P0) and high-priority (P1) issues** before the modular migration in October 2025.

10. **TASK-010**: Implemented cycle detection in BFS
    - Track depth per entity during traversal
    - Enforce shape.maxDepth limit
    - Detect and report graph cycles

11. **TASK-020**: Added comprehensive concurrency tests
    - 4 test files with 30+ test cases
    - Validates all P0 concurrency fixes
    - Stress testing with 100+ concurrent operations

12. **TASK-021**: Wrote architectural documentation
    - 400+ pages across 4 comprehensive documents
    - ARCHITECTURE.md, THREADING.md, PERFORMANCE.md, MIGRATION.md
    - Complete coverage of system design and patterns

13. **TASK-022**: Improved error context in GraphCompositionException
    - Includes root key, shape ID, partial progress
    - Maps failed entities with their errors
    - Structured diagnostics for debugging

### ✅ P2 Medium Priority Completed (5/9)

14. **TASK-011**: Fixed KeyMutex memory leak
    - Implemented LRU eviction (max 1000 mutexes)
    - Thread-safe with mutex protection

15. **TASK-012**: Added platform-specific optimizations
    - @JvmOverloads for Java interop
    - @JsExport for JavaScript/TypeScript
    - Enhanced multiplatform compatibility

16. **TASK-013**: Improved StoreException classification
    - Added isRetryable property to all exception types
    - Smart HTTP status code handling
    - Message-based exception inference

17. **TASK-014**: Fixed stableHash() implementation
    - Proper 64-bit hash combining for ByIdKey
    - Content-based hashing for QueryKey
    - Better collision resistance

18. **TASK-016**: Documented idempotency semantics
    - Comprehensive KDoc for all strategies
    - Use cases, examples, best practices
    - 186 lines of production-ready documentation

19. **TASK-023**: Standardized generic parameter naming
    - Renamed V→Domain, K→Key, Db→Entity
    - Self-documenting type signatures
    - Complete migration guide created

### ⏳ Remaining Tasks (3 tasks - moved to active TODO)

20. **TASK-015**: Consolidate Policy Classes (P2)
    - Status: Moved to active TODO.md
    - Requires API breaking changes
    - Target: Pre-1.0 release

21. **TASK-017**: Test Inline Class Platform Differences (P2)
    - Status: Moved to active TODO.md
    - Platform-specific serialization/reflection tests
    - Target: Pre-1.0 release

22. **TASK-018**: Implement Incremental Recomposition (P2)
    - Status: Moved to active TODO.md (post-1.0)
    - Performance optimization for Compose
    - Target: Post-1.0 enhancement

Note: TASK-019 (Pagination) may be redundant as `:paging` module already exists

## Why This Is Archived

This document tracked production readiness for the **monolithic `:store` module**, which was deleted on October 5, 2025, as part of the modular migration. All references in this document point to:

```
store/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/mattramotar/storex/store/...  ← DELETED
```

The new modular architecture has:
```
core/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/mattramotar/storex/core/...
mutations/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/mattramotar/storex/mutations/...
normalization/runtime/src/commonMain/kotlin/dev/mattramotar/storex/normalization/...
```

**All completed work was successfully migrated** to the appropriate modules during the restructure.

## Impact on Modular Migration

The production readiness work directly enabled the successful modular migration:

1. **Thread Safety Foundation**: P0 fixes ensured no race conditions in split modules
2. **API Simplification**: Reduced complexity made module boundaries clearer
3. **Documentation**: Architectural docs guided CQRS separation (core vs mutations)
4. **Testing**: Concurrency tests validated correctness during split

**Timeline**: Production review (Oct 4) → Modular migration (Oct 4-5) → Store deletion (Oct 5)
